Random scripts for very specific tasks

Scenes2Meshlib.gd is a script that will take a directory and search for a specified extension, which by default is .FBX, and then convert the files in that directory into a unified mesh library file. This is handy when you have a bunch of models you need as one meshlib.
You'll need to set the path and set a lib name of your choice.
